# micro-chat

micro-chat is a really small hobby project, trying to implement a messaging service for the BBC micro:bit V2.

## Functionality

1. A menu accessible from the Logo pin
2. Writing and sending messages at runtime
3. Receiving and reading messages at runtime
4. Changing the radio group at runtime
5. Very dumb encryption using the vigenere cipher with the senders name as key

## Usage

This repository doesn't provide a pre-compiled .hex file. You'll have to go to [python.microbit.org](), open the file and save it as a .hex file.
Move the downloaded file as usual to your connected BBC micro:bit V2 and it'll flash the program.
